# BOOK III: PULSE (THE KINETIC ECONOMY)

### §1 P_gen (Proof of Contribution)
Money created only by entropy-reducing work. No fiat.

### §3 Demurrage (Entropy Simulation)
Money rusts (~5% p.a.) to force circulation.
* **Human Clause (Decay Freeze):**
    * Pause demurrage for 12 months every 5 years (Grief/Birth).
    * Logic: The system must not punish those who need to breathe.
