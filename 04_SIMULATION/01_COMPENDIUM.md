# BOOK IV: SIMULATION (THE PROGNOSTIC HORIZON)
> **Source:** System Audit + Ger Core
> **Status:** Reference
> **Scope:** Digital Twin & Legislative Validation

## PREAMBLE: GOVERNING BY KNOWLEDGE, NOT HOPE

**Logic:**
Introducing untested parameters (new laws) into a complex system carries incalculable risks (Cobra Effect). Live experiments on humans are ethically inadmissible.
Therefore: *Simulation before Implementation.*

---

## CHAPTER 1: THE DIGITAL TWIN

### §1 Data Infrastructure
**Logic:** To predict the future, you must know the present perfectly.
**Protocol:** The Cluster maintains a real-time virtual model of its energy and resource flows. Personal data is anonymized; flow data is precise.
**Transfer:** We have a "Sim City" version of our reality. We test ideas there first.

---

## CHAPTER 2: THE SHADOW RUN

### §2 The Simulation Mandate
**Logic:** No code change without validation.
**Protocol:**
Before a law is voted on, it must survive the **Shadow Run**:
1.  **Injection:** The law is programmed into the Digital Twin.
2.  **Time Lapse:** The system simulates 10 years in minutes.
3.  **Stress Test:** Worst-case scenarios (drought, crash) are applied.
**Transfer:**
Politicians cannot promise paradise anymore. If the simulation says "This law causes poverty in 5 years," the law is blocked.

### §3 ZVF Check
**Protocol:**
If $\text{Suffering}(\text{Sim}) > \text{Suffering}(\text{Now})$, the update is vetoed by the kernel (`VETO_BY_MATH`).

---

## CHAPTER 3: REVERSE ONUS

### §4 Reversal of Proof
**Logic:** The innovator bears the risk.
**Protocol:**
Corporations must prove a product is harmless (via simulation) *before* market entry.
**Transfer:**
You don't have to prove their chemical made you sick. They have to prove it is safe before they can sell it.

## CHAPTER 5: AUDIT VECTORS (STRESS SCENARIOS)
*(Restored from Gap Analysis)*

Every law must pass these three standard simulations:

### Vector A: Axiomatic Singularity (The Dictator Scenario)
* **Scenario:** A Cluster Council attempts to centralize power.
* **Check:** Do the *13th Instance* (Rotation) and *Liquid Democracy* (Revocation) mechanisms engage?
* **Pass:** The power grab fails due to cryptographic lockouts without violence.

### Vector B: Bio-Integral Resilience (The Drought Scenario)
* **Scenario:** Resource base ($\Omega$) drops by 50%.
* **Check:** Does the *Circuit Breaker* stop money printing? Is *Node Zero* prioritized over luxury?
* **Pass:** No Node falls below subsistence level, even if the luxury market collapses.

### Vector C: Isolation (The Mars Scenario)
* **Scenario:** The Cluster loses contact with the Federation permanently.
* **Check:** Does *Submarine Mode* engage? Can the local ledger sustain trade?
* **Pass:** The Cluster stabilizes as a sovereign micro-state.
