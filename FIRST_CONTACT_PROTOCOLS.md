# FIRST CONTACT PROTOCOLS (ONBOARDING)
> **Target Group:** New Nodes (Refugees from the Legacy System)
> **Goal:** Restoration of Sovereignty in 3 Phases

---

## PHASE 1: MENTAL DETOX (DAY 1-7)

Before you can use the system, you must delete the cognitive errors of the old system.
1.  **Forget "Guilt":** You have no guilt. You only have causality. If you make a mistake, fix it.
2.  **Forget "Ownership":** You do not own land, you steward it. You do not own ideas, you share them.
3.  **Forget "Retirement":** No one will save you when you are old, except your Cluster. Build relationships, not money.

**Task:** Mentally install the **Curiosity Contract**. When you argue, repeat your opponent's argument before replying.

## PHASE 2: PHYSICAL AUTARKY (DAY 8-30)

Lovalis is not an App. It is a way of life. You must become **Node Zero**.
1.  **Energy:** Acquire a solar panel and a buffer battery. You must be able to power your communication device for 72h without the grid.
2.  **Data:** Withdraw your data from Google/Apple. Store it locally on an encrypted drive (precursor to *Node One*).
3.  **Supplies:** Store water/food for 14 days. A sovereign Node cannot be blackmailed by hunger.

## PHASE 3: SOCIAL SYNCHRONIZATION (FROM DAY 30)

You are now a Node. Now you need a Cluster.
1.  **Scan:** Find 3-5 people in your vicinity who are also "awake".
2.  **Handshake:** Form a *Triad*. Exchange numbers (Signal/Session, not WhatsApp).
3.  **Puls Test:** Start settling services among yourselves not in Dollars/Euros, but in hours or favors. Keep a small book. This is your first *Ledger*.

**Welcome to Reality.**
