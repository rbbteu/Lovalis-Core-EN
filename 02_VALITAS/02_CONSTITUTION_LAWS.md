# THE LOVALIS CONSTITUTION (LAWS 1-27)

---

### §1 The Bio-Integrity Law (Habeas Corpus)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
The physical and psychological integrity of a Node is the basis of the system. Without integrity, there is no participation.
**Protocol:**
Any action that causes physical harm ($L_{phys}$) to a Node is a Priority 1 Logical Breach. The system reacts with immediate isolation of the aggressor (Restitution Protocol).
**Transfer:**
Your body is your fortress. No state and no person may touch you against your will.

### §2 The Commons Law (Allmende)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
Resources essential for life (water, air, land) cannot be "owned" exclusively. They are managed as commons.
**Protocol:**
Land ownership is replaced by "Stewardship". You have the right to use the land as long as you maintain its Bio-Integral value. If you destroy the land, you lose the stewardship.
**Transfer:**
You don't own the planet. You lease it from future generations.

### §3 The Law of Symmetry (Golden Rule)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
Interaction must be symmetrical. Power requires liability.
**Protocol:**
Who gives an order must be liable for the result. Limited liability (e.g., Corporations) is banned for decision-makers.
**Transfer:**
You break it, you buy it. No CEO can hide behind a company name anymore.

### §4 Data Sovereignty (White Silence)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
Information about a Node is an extension of its mind.
**Protocol:**
Personal data is encrypted with the Node's private key. Access is only granted via temporary, revocable tokens.
**Transfer:**
Your secrets belong to you. Not Facebook, not the state.

### §5 The Protection of Minors (Ward Protocol)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
Children are future Nodes. Their development is a system priority.
**Protocol:**
See Book II, Chapter 1 (Growth Budget).
**Transfer:**
Kids are VIPs.

### §6 The Right to Truth (Source Verification)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
False information creates entropy.
**Protocol:**
Public news must be cryptographically signed by the author. Anonymity is allowed for opinions, but not for factual claims affecting the public.
**Transfer:**
No fake news bots. If you claim a fact, you sign it with your name.

### §7 Energy Autarky Law
**Logic (The Axiom):**
Dependence on a central grid is slavery.
**Protocol:**
Every residential unit must be capable of generating 50% of its base load (Solar/Wind).
**Transfer:**
Power to the people, literally.

### §8 Shelter Priority Law
**Logic (The Axiom):**
Sleep is a biological necessity.
**Protocol:**
The primary residence (up to 40sqm/person) is unseizable.
**Transfer:**
You cannot become homeless. Even if you go bankrupt, you keep your roof.

### §9 Economic Mobility Law
**Logic (The Axiom):**
Stagnation kills innovation.
**Protocol:**
Barriers to entry (Guilds, excessive licenses) are minimized. Anyone can offer P_gen services.
**Transfer:**
If you can do the job, you can do the job. No gatekeepers.

### §10 The Right to Exit (Hermit)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
Forced participation is tyranny.
**Protocol:**
Any Node can declare "Hermit Status". They lose access to Puls/Nexus but retain Node Zero rights (Land/Water).
**Transfer:**
You can opt out. The system leaves you alone if you want.

---

### §11 The Submarine Law (Autarky)
**Logic:** Dependency on central infrastructure creates fragility.
**Protocol:** Every cluster must be technically capable of "Islanding". In case of $Link Loss$, the local grid and ledger take over immediately.
**Transfer:** When the internet dies, your village keeps running.

### §12 The 13th Instance (Rotation of Power)
**Logic:** Static executive power leads to corruption.
**Protocol:** The highest admin key is split among 3 random Nodes from geographically distant clusters. They rotate every 4 years.
**Transfer:** There is no President. There are only temporary guardians who don't know each other and leave office before they can be bribed.

### §13 The Glass House Act (Transparency)
**Logic:** Privacy protects the weak; transparency checks the powerful.
**Protocol:** Any Node holding public office automatically switches their wallet to `PUBLIC` mode. All income/expenses are visible to the electorate.
**Transfer:** If you want to govern, you must be financially naked. Corruption becomes impossible because everyone can see your bank account.

### §14 The Open Source Mandate (Code is Law)
**Logic:** Secret code in governance equals secret laws.
**Protocol:** All software managing commons or justice must be under a Permissive License.
**Transfer:** We don't "trust" the voting machine. We check the code.

### §15 Liquid Democracy Act
**Logic:** Competence is topical. You cannot represent a person, only a topic.
**Protocol:** Votes can be delegated per topic (e.g., Energy vote -> Engineer). Delegation can be revoked in real-time.
**Transfer:** You lend your voice to experts you trust, but you hold the leash.

### §16 Circular Duty (Cradle-to-Cradle)
**Logic:** There is no "waste" in nature, only misplaced resources.
**Protocol:** Manufacturers remain owners of their materials. If a product ends up in a landfill, the cleanup cost is automatically deducted from the company via smart contract.
**Transfer:** Companies stop building junk that breaks, because they have to pay to clean it up.

### §17 Preventive Incentivization
**Logic:** A system profiting from sickness (GDP) will maintain sickness.
**Protocol:** Doctors and Police are paid based on the *absence* of entropy (Health/Safety), not the frequency of intervention.
**Transfer:** Your doctor earns more if you stay healthy. He has an incentive to keep you out of the hospital.

### §18 Evolutionary Update Law
**Logic:** Rigid systems break.
**Protocol:** The Constitution can be patched via Shadow Run simulation and Supermajority vote.

### §19 Polycentric Security (Porcupine Strategy)
**Logic:** Central armies enable aggression. Decentralized defense enables safety.
**Protocol:** Defense is based on local militias and automated systems, activated only within geo-fenced home territories.
**Transfer:** We cannot invade others, but we are impossible to conquer.

### §20 Cognitive Freedom
**Logic:** The mind is the root of sovereignty.
**Protocol:** Algorithms designed to trigger dopamine loops or addiction are banned in public spaces.
**Transfer:** You have the right to walk down the street without being manipulated by ads.

### §21 Resonance Priority
**Logic:** Cooperation is a non-zero-sum game.
**Protocol:** High *Rep-Score* grants priority access to commons resources.
**Transfer:** Being a good neighbor pays off literally.

### §22 The Curiosity Law (Discourse Hygiene)
**Logic:** Polarization stems from straw-manning.
**Protocol:** *Steel-Manning* is mandatory in public debate. You must summarize the opponent's view to their satisfaction before rebutting.
**Transfer:** We listen before we argue.

### §23 Inclusion Mandate
**Logic:** Excluding nodes wastes compute power.
**Protocol:** Universal Design is a validation condition for all public infrastructure.

### §24 Legacy Amnesty
**Logic:** Transition requires a clean slate.
**Protocol:** Upon joining, all legacy debts (Fiat) are ignored. Tabula Rasa.

### §25 Fractal Scaling
**Logic:** Complexity scales exponentially.
**Protocol:** New laws must be proven in a local cluster before federal rollout.

### §26 Asymmetric Infiltration
**Logic:** Direct confrontation provokes destruction.
**Protocol:** Lovalis operates as an overlay network until it renders the legacy system obsolete.

### §27 Finality Law (Fail-Safe to Anarchy)
**Logic:** If the system becomes tyrannical, it must die.
**Protocol:** If the ZVF detects systemic corruption, the *Dissolution Protocol* releases all clusters into total sovereignty.
**Transfer:** The system has a suicide switch to prevent dictatorship.
