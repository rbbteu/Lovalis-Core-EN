# BOOK II: VALITAS (JUSTICE & STATUS)

## 1. THE WARD PROTOCOL (CHILD PROTECTION)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
A child is not the property of its parents, but a sovereign Node in development. The randomness of birth (rich/poor parents) must not determine the future.

**Legal/Scientific (The Protocol):**
* **Growth Budget:** Every child receives direct resource allocation from the Nexus (education, nutrition), bypassing parental wallets.
* **Guardian Node:** Parents act as fiduciaries, monitored by the cluster to ensure resources are used for the child.

**What does this mean?**
Poverty is not hereditary. Every child gets the same start—the same best food, the same best education—regardless of whether their parents are doctors or unemployed.

## 2. THE GRAND TOUR (CALIBRATION)
**Logic (The Axiom):**
A static mind cannot govern a dynamic system. Empathy requires physical experience.

**Legal/Scientific (The Protocol):**
Between ages 18-21, every Node rotates through 3 different clusters (e.g., Agriculture, Tech, Care). The system funds this travel ($Calibration Budget$) to ensure every citizen understands the whole system before they vote.
