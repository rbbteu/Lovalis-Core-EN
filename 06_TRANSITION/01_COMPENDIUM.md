## PREAMBLE: EVOLUTION OVER REVOLUTION

**Logic:**
Systems born of violent revolution carry the seed of violence in their DNA. Lovalis does not fight the Legacy System; it renders it obsolete through superior efficiency (Buckminster Fuller Doctrine).

## CHAPTER 1: SUBMARINE TACTICS

### §1 The Overlay Network
**Logic:** Open confrontation provokes bans.
**Protocol:** Lovalis operates as a gamified *Overlay*. Legally, Puls is a "Bonus Point System". Physically, it is a mesh network. We are invisible until we are too numerous to be ignored.

### §2 Submarine Mode (Diving)
**Logic:** If the Legacy System attacks (Bank Freeze), we dive.
**Protocol:**
1.  **Link Cut:** Sever interfaces to Fiat economy.
2.  **Autarky:** Activate local cluster supply (Barter/Puls).
3.  **Routing:** Switch to LoRaWAN/Mesh communication.

**What does this mean?**
They cannot pull the plug because we are not plugged into their socket.

## CHAPTER 2: COGNITIVE INFILTRATION

### §3 The Trojan SDK (V-Gate)
**Logic:** People switch systems for convenience, not ideology.
**Protocol:**
We distribute the *V-Gate App*.
* **The Bait:** Encrypted chat, secure storage, health tracking.
* **The Hook:** The backend runs on the Puls Ledger. Users become citizens simply by using the app.

### §4 Asymmetric Attraction
**Logic:** The old system generates stress. Lovalis generates resilience.
**Protocol:** We rely on *Brain Drain*. We attract the engineers, doctors, and farmers by offering them *Purpose* and *Autonomy* instead of just debt.

## CHAPTER 3: THE ECONOMIC AIRLOCK

### §5 The Adapter Protocol
**Logic:** We need an interface between the dying Euro/Dollar and the living Puls.
**Protocol:**
* **Import (Fiat -> Puls):** Fiat currency can be brought in but is immediately converted into physical assets (Solar, Land). No "Puls" is minted from Fiat.
* **Export (Puls -> Fiat):** One-way ticket. You cannot cash out Puls to Fiat. This prevents speculation.

**What does this mean?**
Lovalis is not a casino. You can bring money in to build a life, but you cannot use us to speculate and run away with profits.
