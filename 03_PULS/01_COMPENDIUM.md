## PREAMBLE: KINETICS OVER STATICS

**Logic (The Axiom):**
Money is not a commodity; it is information about available energy. In a thermodynamic universe, perpetual energy conservation without loss (entropy) is impossible. A currency system that preserves value forever or multiplies it via interest without work violates physics and must collapse.
Lovalis corrects this error via **Puls (Kinetic Money)**.

## CHAPTER 1: P_GEN (MONEY CREATION)

### §1 Proof of Contribution
**Logic:** Money must never be created *ex nihilo* (debt). It must only exist as a digital equivalent of real, entropy-reducing work.
**Protocol:**
The *Minting* of new Puls units follows the function $P_{gen}$:
$$ P_{gen}(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t} (\text{Work}_{val} \times \text{Entropy}_{red}) \, dt $$
1.  **Trigger:** A Node performs work (e.g., builds a table, treats a patient).
2.  **Validation:** The receiver validates the result.
3.  **Minting:** Only *after* validation does the Kernel create the money.
**Transfer:**
Money is a receipt for work done. No work, no money. Inflation via "printing press" is impossible because every coin is backed by a real action.

### §2 The Circuit Breaker (Ecological Cap)
**Logic:** The economy cannot outgrow the ecology.
**Protocol:**
If the money supply ($M$) threatens to exceed the bio-capacity ($\Omega$), the Kernel triggers `STOP_MINTING`.
**Transfer:**
It’s like a fuse in your house. If we try to consume more than the planet regenerates, the system cuts the power (money creation) before the cable burns (ecosystem collapse).

## CHAPTER 2: DEMURRAGE (CIRCULATION)

### §3 The Entropy Curve (Currency Rust)

> **VISUALIZATION:** Demurrage Decay over Time ($t$)

<br>

**Logic (The Axiom):**
Everything in nature decays (bread molds, iron rusts). Only money was "immortal". This allowed the rich to hoard wealth without work. Lovalis introduces natural decay to money.

**Legal/Scientific (The Protocol):**
Liquidity in the *Puls Wallet* is subject to a **Demurrage Fee** (approx. 5-7% p.a.).
* **Algorithm:** The fee is deducted hourly (`Balance = Balance * (1 - Rate)^(dt)`).
* **Exemption:** Long-term investments in infrastructure or nature are *exempt* because that value "works".

**What does this mean? (The Transfer):**
Money is like fresh fruit. You must use it (spend) or plant it (invest), otherwise it rots.
You can no longer rest on a pile of cash. If you want to stay rich, you must lend your money to others so they can work with it. Money flows to where it is needed, it doesn't stagnate.

### §4 Negative Interest as a Motor
**Logic:** Positive interest rewards possession (Past). Negative interest rewards activity (Present).
**Protocol:**
Loans in Lovalis often have 0% or negative interest. Creditors are happy to lend money to escape Demurrage.
**Transfer:**
The rich *want* to lend you money to build your house, because losing a little via a cheap loan is better than losing a lot via Demurrage. The power shifts from the lender to the worker.

## CHAPTER 3: ACCOUNT TOPOLOGY

### §5 Node Zero Wallet (Survival)
**Logic:** Fear of starvation blocks rationality.
**Protocol:**
* **Demurrage-Free:** Funds here do not rot.
* **Unseizable:** No creditor can touch this.
* **Capped:** Only covers basic needs (Rent, Food, Energy).

### §6 Puls Wallet (Luxury)
**Logic:** Luxury is subject to thermodynamics.
**Protocol:**
* **Demurrage-Active:** Subject to decay.
* **Public:** Subject to Glass House transparency (if holding office).
* **Function:** Used for business, investing, and status goods.
