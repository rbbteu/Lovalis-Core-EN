## 1. What is Lovalis?
Lovalis is neither a state nor a party. It is a technical-logical infrastructure designed to ensure we can coexist without destroying each other or our planet. It replaces blind trust in politicians with verifiable protocols.

## 2. The Three Pillars
* **Ethics over Profit:** The system prioritizes the minimization of suffering over economic gain.
* **Nature as the Foundation:** Our prosperity is directly linked to the health of our environment.
* **Technology as a Servant:** You retain absolute control over your own data.

## 3. The New Currency (Puls)
* **Value through Labor:** Currency is only generated through actual contribution to the community.
* **No Hoarding:** Currency "rusts" slowly (Decay) to remain in circulation.
* **Basic Security:** Your primary needs are untouchably protected within your "Node Zero".

## 4. Real Democracy
* **Local Clusters:** We live in manageable groups of no more than 150 people.
* **Power Deconstruction:** Public roles rotate every 4 years via a lottery system.

## 5. Security (Submarine Mode)
Should the outside world collapse, your local cluster switches to autarky. Thanks to local energy and decentralized data, your life simply continues.
