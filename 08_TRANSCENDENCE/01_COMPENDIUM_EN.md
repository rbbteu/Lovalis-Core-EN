### §1 Separation of Structure and Meaning
Lovalis guarantees survival, not meaning. Religion and Art are up to the Cluster.
The system is the canvas, culture is the paint.

### §2 Voluntary Hardship (The Challenge Protocol)
To prevent boredom in a perfect system (The Perfection Paradox):
* **Survival Year:** Living without Node Zero support voluntarily.
* **Epic Quests:** Cross-cluster missions with high difficulty.
* **Reward:** Resonance Badges (Status only, no money).

### §3 Initiation Rites
Youth (14-16) simulate the "Old World" (Scarcity/Capitalism) for 3 days to understand why Lovalis exists.
Only after understanding the past, they gain voting rights for the future.
